    This is a friendly reminder that you have a week left to contact your current batch of 20 participants. After next week you will need to “return” the participants who you have not yet contacted, have been excluded, or have declined. Please remember to update the Release Report as it is due back to the registry coordinator at the end of the two week release period.

    Regards,

    Dear Researcher,

    This is a friendly reminder that your release period has come to an end. You need to send the completed Release Report to the research coordinator at commresearchregistry@northwestern.edu by the end of today. You can find the Release Report Excel attached to the email sent on day 1 of your release period. All participants not listed as enrolled must be “returned” to the registry and their contact information forfeited. Please keep in mind that timeliness of participant returns affects your ability to use the registry in the future.

    Regards,

    The Communication Research Registry Team
